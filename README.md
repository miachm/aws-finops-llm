# AWS FinOps tool

This is a prototype of a tool who allows you to describe AWS bills using chatGPT. The tool is able to access real bill data from your AWS account.

You need to have AWS credentials configured and a OPENAI_API_KEY configured in your machine.

Start with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python finops.py
```
